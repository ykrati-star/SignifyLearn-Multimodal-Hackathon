# SignifyLearn: Inclusive Multimodal Learning Assistant
Project Overview

**SignifyLearn** is a real-time, multimodal AI assistant designed to eliminate the educational barrier for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community in India. We move beyond simple captions by integrating and synthesizing audio and video streams to provide a unified, accessible learning experience.

1. **Core Principle :** **Integration over Addition** (Hackathon Criterion 1)
2. **Target Impact :** Bridging the education gap for the 18+ million people in India facing hearing loss.

Core Features & Innovation

We provide three streams of synchronized output, driven by our **Multimodal Fusion Engine**:

1.  **Synchronized Sign Language Animation:** Real-time rendering of Indian Sign Language (ISL) based on spoken content.
2.  **Contextual Summaries:** Uses NLP to simplify complex lecture material into easy-to-read takeaways, demonstrating **Context Awareness** (Hackathon Criterion 2).
3.  **Sign Language Coach (Differentiator):** An interactive module using Computer Vision to track user gestures and provide real-time feedback, enabling hearing peers and teachers to practice sign language.

Technical Feasibility & Stack

This project is built to be a demonstrable MVP for Phase 2. Our technology choices prioritize speed, accuracy, and **Feasibility** (Hackathon Criterion 5).

1. **Backend & Orchestration :** **Python**
2. **Audio Transcription :** High-performance, low-latency **Speech-to-Text (STT) APIs**.
3. **Computer Vision :** **MediaPipe** or **OpenPose** for robust real-time hand and body pose estimation (used for the Sign Coach and teacher gesture tracking).
4. **Data Strategy :** Leveraging existing **Indian Sign Language (ISL) datasets** for model validation and animation rendering, ensuring **Indian Context** compatibility (Hackathon Criterion 4).

Relevance to the Indian Context

The solution is specifically designed for the challenges facing the education sector in India:

1. Addresses a massive segment of **18 million+** citizens who lack adequate digital learning tools.
2. Architecture is planned to support the eventual integration of **regional Indian Sign Language variations**, acknowledging India's linguistic diversity.
